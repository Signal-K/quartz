Pygame API We&amp;rsquo;re starting off with a simple python game that can be used to:
Mirror Phaser, Unity gameplay, assets, player [account] data (via Lootlocker API, Metamask, etc) Provide endpoints to the game&amp;rsquo;s API in different languages The game code can be found in the unity-lootlocker branch of the signal-k/dabpi repository.
Level class The game&amp;rsquo;s level information, structure and formula.</description></item><item><title>Database Prefabs</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/unity/DatabasePrefabs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/unity/DatabasePrefabs/</guid><description>Links in with login .
Basically what we&amp;rsquo;re doing is setting up a set of prefabs for the databases we&amp;rsquo;ll be using with Unity. Items and their assets will be received from LootLocker. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m displaying the items in a Scroll View. This is causing some problems with the prefabs as the Text (I&amp;rsquo;m using TextMeshPro exclusively while I work on this scene as it&amp;rsquo;s proven to work with the scripting I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing) is consistently behind the image prefab: I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on getting more adept with TextMeshPro for the scenes (including content items) and also with displaying/rendering items in an inventory.</description></item><item><title>Login Functionality</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/unity/login/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/unity/login/</guid><description>Contents:
Login scene Meta Plan Database &amp;amp; API Login scene Meta Notion Page Public docs Unity-Demo#5 ; Unity-Demo#6 Plan Plan: let’s create a bit of a scene (after the player finishes the “orientation” or tutorial mission) where they log in to their wallet. Let’s also allow them to connect to an email address (as a backup).
Start by integrating with Metamask before moving it to Moralis, allowing users to input an email address, username, and then a “profile” (what they look like) .</description></item></channel></rss>
