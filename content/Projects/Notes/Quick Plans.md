Can we deeplink to files (either in local code editor or on github), view in backlinks?

Custom layouts for pages/docs like a table, sort of like a portfolio item

Possibly a function/layout that will show all files in an internal folder (like Tables )

Custom pages/sidebars for when in "project management mode" for example

Tie backlinks into multiple categories e.g. commits, pull requests

Supabase microframeworks + deepnote

Jira export into Quartz

Tags -> for projects, also tag git issues/commits (maybe use Github discussions/issues like utteranc.es. The key here is creating a workflow that is simple to follow. Maybe custom account management would be the way to go, don't want to lock into using Github)
